      <h1>About Batman</h1>
      <h2>The Man Behind the Mask</h2>
      <p>
      Batman, whose real name is Bruce Wayne, is a billionaire industrialist and philanthropist who has devoted his life to protecting Gotham City from crime and corruption. As a young boy, Bruce witnessed the brutal murder of his parents, Thomas and Martha Wayne, during a street mugging—a traumatic event that left an indelible mark on his psyche and fueled his lifelong mission for justice. Unlike many superheroes, Batman possesses no superhuman abilities. Instead, he relies on his extraordinary intellect, detective skills, physical conditioning, and mastery of martial arts. He combines these talents with cutting-edge technology, advanced gadgets, and the resources of Wayne Enterprises to combat the criminal underworld. Beyond his crime-fighting persona, Bruce Wayne is also known as a shrewd businessman and generous philanthropist, using his wealth and influence to support Gotham's social institutions and initiatives. His unwavering moral code, determination, and resilience make him not only a symbol of fear for criminals but also a beacon of hope for the innocent.
